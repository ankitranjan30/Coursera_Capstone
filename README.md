Built statistical models to help stakeholders identify locations to open a new restaurant through candidate neighborhood analysis. Reduced candidates from 206 to 7 through clustering algorithms like K-Means (Euclidean distance), DBSCAN and HDBSCAN (Haversine distance) to identify the candidate neighborhoods from the maps.
